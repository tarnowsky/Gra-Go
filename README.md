# Go Game

## Project Description
This project presents a Go game, developed in C and C++ languages, as part of the "Fundamentals of Programming" course. 
The game was created during the first semester of my computer science studies at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. 
It was my first major programming project, with a focus on implementing data structures and algorithms.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages:** C, C++
- **Libraries:** [conio2.h](https://github.com/Fernando-Lafeta/Biblioteca-Conio-2/blob/master/conio2.h)
- **Development Environment:** Microsoft Visual Studio, gcc, g++

## Main Project Goals
- Learn and apply basic data structures and algorithms.
- Develop programming skills in C and C++ languages.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using the console.
- Create a functional version of the Go game with basic rules.

## Features
- Support for basic Go game rules.
- Console interface allowing easy user interaction.
- Real-time display of the board and game state.
